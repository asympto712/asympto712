I'm currently studying Scientific Computing in Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. I am interested in Reinforcement Learning and their application in game development(designing powerful game AI, etc..) and simulation science (emergence of collaborative behavior, modelling of economy using trained agents, etc..)
