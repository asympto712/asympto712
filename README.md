## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying Scientific Computing in Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. My focus is on Reinforcement Learning and AI.
My other interests are...
- Game development (I'm a huge fan of cool indie games developed by a very passionate solo-devs. ([Dwarf Fortress](https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), [Kenshi](https://lofigames.com/)))
- Multi-agent systems a.k.a Biology a.k.a Multi-agent systems (My academical kink, although I don't consider myself very academic)
- Decentralized systems (Not just the benefit they have over the traditional monolithic systems. I think they embody an advanced view on modern social governance and economy)
- Theory of Mind (Please, somebody build the mathematical theory of consiousness before I die!)
- Computer Science in general (I should've started earlier...)

(The list above is not ordered on anything)
